Description: This package provides a framework for specifying spatially, temporally and spatio-temporally varying coefficient models using Generalized Additive Models with Gaussian Process smooths. The smooths are parameterised with location and / or time attributes. Importantly it provides a framework for investigating the nature and presence of any space-time dependencies in the data, allowing the user to evaluate different model forms (specifications), to pick the most probable model or to combine multiple varying coefficient models using Bayesian Model Averaging.
